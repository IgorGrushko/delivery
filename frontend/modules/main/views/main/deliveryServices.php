<!-- Furniture Deluxing -->
<span class="grayBox">
    <h2>Furniture Deluxing</h2>
    <p>
        This important process adds significant value to the retailed in reducing returns. The cost of reverse logistics
        (returns) in the furniture business can erode retailer profit margins. <span class="darkRed">CBC delivery & distribution Services</span> understands
        this and works on the front end to eliminate potential flaws that could cause a customer to reject a piece of furniture.﻿
    </p>
    <p>
        We offer complete deluxing service where no piece of furniture leaves our warehouse without being carefully inspected,
        touched up, and prepared for a perfect delivery. Small blemishes that may occur during shipping are repaired or touched
        up before the delivery team blanket wraps and loads the furniture for delivery.
